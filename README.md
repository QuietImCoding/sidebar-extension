## What it does

- **Automatic Post Discovery**: As you browse the web, the extension automatically shows posts that mention your current webpage
- **View Options**: Toggle between compact (reddit-like) and full post views

## Privacy Considerations

- Since the extension automatically searches a backend (Bluesky) using your current URL, your IP address would be visible to it's servers. This only matters since it's done "automatically", otherwise it's the same as just searching a url in the searchbox on the website.
- **Note**: this is a moot point if you are logged-in and like/reply.
- To account for this:
  - Use the *whitelist* feature to only auto-search on sites you trust
  - Enable *manual* mode to control when searches happen
  - Or just use a VPN

## Future Ideas

- **Cross-Platform Search**: Integration with other "open" social platforms (HN, Arena, local Obsidian?)
- **Authentication**: Log in to like, repost, and reply to posts directly
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter posts from your follows??
