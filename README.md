Discover what people are saying about any webpage: a *sidebar* browser extension that shows you real-time discussions about the sites you visit (bsky atm).

> i also made a [web app](https://annotation-sidebar-demo.pages.dev/) if you want to test it first (no installation needed)  
> *note*: [bsky](https://bsky.app/profile/bnewbold.net/post/3lnvhcghi6s23) is likely removing unauthenticated `/search` access so will need to login to see posts unless I make a proxy or my own search cluster (comment if you have ideas [#8](https://github.com/hzoo/extension-annotation-sidebar/issues/8))

## What it does

- **Automatic Post Discovery**: As you browse the web, the extension automatically shows posts that mention your current webpage
- **Actions**: Log in to like, repost, and reply to posts directly
- **Annotate**: select text on the page to quote and annotate

## Privacy Considerations

- Since the extension automatically searches a backend (Bluesky) using your current URL, your IP address would be visible to it's servers. This only matters since it's done "automatically", otherwise it's the same as just searching a url in the searchbox on the website.
- **Note**: this is a moot point if you are logged-in and like/reply.
- To account for this:
  - Only auto-search on sites you trust
  - Enable *manual* mode to control when searches happen
  - Or just use a VPN

## Future Ideas

- **Cross-Platform Search**: Integration with other "open" social platforms (HN, Arena, local Obsidian?)
- **Smart Filtering**: Filter posts from your follows??

## Local Download

> You may need to build the extension yourself if the zip (not source code) isn't there (see below)

- Download the corresponding `zip` from [releases](https://github.com/hzoo/extension-annotation-sidebar/releases)
  - Chorme: go to `chrome://extensions/` and click "Load unpacked" (enable Developer Mode)
  - Firefox: go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` and click "Load Temporary Add-onâ€¦"

## Local Dev

```sh
bun install
bun run dev
# check /.output folder
bun run build
bun run build:ff
```
